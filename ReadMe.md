#SWBF Web Client

Attempts to recreate the battlefront client with all original code/art/everything
This client has a goal of connecting to original software servers, while studying them
to recreate the server software also!

See developer instructions for setting up the development environment:
https://github.com/RepComm/swbf_web_client/blob/master/DevelopmentSetupInstructions.txt

I'll write more later!
