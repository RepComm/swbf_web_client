#SWBF Web Client*

Attempts to recreate the battlefront client

with all original code/art/everything

This client has a goal of connecting to

original software servers, while studying

them to recreate the server software also!

***Read the Wiki for development instructions, code map, etc:
https://github.com/RepComm/swbf_web_client/wiki ***


I'll write a roadmap of our progress some time soon when I'm not so busy..

Things will be a little slow until about mid-january.
