How do we setup this thing to develop it?
Let's cover EVERYTHING!
Need help? Open an issue on the github page!

1. We need the repository
    https://github.com/RepComm/swbf_web_client

    Clone or download the zip,
    Extract to some projects folder (mine is Desktop/Projects/swbf_web_client)

    You should be able to see something like this:
    Desktop/Projects/swbf_web_client/DevelopmentSetupInstructions.txt

2. We need Node.js
    https://nodejs.org/en/
    Either LTS or Current should work, I use LTS 'for most users'
    LTS should be more stable because it has gone through more testing!
    
3. We need NWjs tools (the top level bit that runs our code)
    https://nwjs.io/
    You want 'Normal' non-sdk version for users like us (we're not developing nwjs, just WITH it)
    It is a ZIP archieve that we extract somewhere useful.
    I have put mine in C:/Program Files/nwjs
    
    Example path to my executable: C:/Program Files/nwjs/nw.exe 
    
3.? ====MAYBE OPTIONAL, YOU DO THIS LATER IF YOU NEED TO! NO BIG DEAL====
    
    I had to edit my environment variable to be able to use 'nw' command from any command prompt,
    but VSCode extension seems to be able to find NWJS binarys by itself..
    
    Regardless, here are instructions on how to add the path of NWJS to PATH environment variable
        Control Panel - > System And Securety - > System - > Advanced System Settings ->
        Environment Variables - > Select 'PATH' and click 'Edit' button - >

        You will see an edit field that looks something like this (can be empty):
        C:\Users\Jonathan\AppData\Roaming\npm;C:\Program Files\Microsoft VS Code\bin

        Semicolon separates each path, so we'll just add ours to the beginning, and add a semicolon after it
        ______________________
        C:\Program Files\nwjs;C:\Users\Jonathan\AppData\Roaming\npm;C:\Program Files\Microsoft VS Code\bin
        
        Just incase you extracted an extra directory (like I do sometimes):
        This directory needs to have nw.exe in it. nwjs folder was originally named the same as ZIP file it came from.
        So I simplified it to nwjs, which looks nicer in PATH variable anyways..
    
4. We need VSCode (Free, Open Source, Runs everywhere!)
https://code.visualstudio.com/

This setup should be quite fast! No special instructions here.

3. We need VSCode NW.js Extension (Because NW is our web gui host/tool/plugin)
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ruakr.vsc-nwjs

Hit the 'install' button on that page, and it will open in VSCode automagically! It's a special link.
If something goes wrong here, then VSCode might not have installed correctly! You could try installing
this extension manually in VSCode extensions tab on the far left (its a square-ish icon).

NOW, you can open the project in VSCode!
File - > Open Folder - > Select swbf_web_client directory you extracted earlier.

4. EDIT- In order to get NWjs working,
we need to click 'View' menu on VSCode, select 'Command palette'
and type in "NWjs Install" and select it from the drop down. This runs the necessary
'find nwjs installation binaries' task so that we can do our thing!

5. You should be able to run it right off the bat ( fn + F5, or Debug - > Start Debugging ),
it should launch our game window, and some things should be in the DEBUG CONSOLE on the bottom!
